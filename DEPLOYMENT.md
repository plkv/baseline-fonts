# Critical Deployment Setup

## Font Persistence Configuration

To ensure fonts persist across deployments, you need to configure Vercel storage:

### 1. Vercel KV + Blob Storage (Recommended)

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Storage tab
4. Create a KV database
5. Create a Blob store
6. Add these environment variables:
   - `KV_REST_API_URL`
   - `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`  
   - `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`

### 2. Alternative: Database Storage

If you prefer a database approach, add these packages:
```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
# or
npm install @planetscale/database
```

Then configure database URL in environment variables.

## Current Status

- ✅ Font parsing and metadata extraction working
- ✅ OpenType feature detection working  
- ✅ Font preview rendering implemented
- ⚠️ Font persistence requires cloud storage setup
- ✅ Enhanced weight detection (UltraLight=100, SemiBold=600, etc.)
- ✅ Multi-language support detection
- ✅ Comprehensive OpenType feature mapping

## Critical Flow Status

✅ **Upload**: Font files uploaded successfully
✅ **Parsing**: Comprehensive metadata extracted from font files
✅ **Storage**: Files stored with proper metadata
✅ **Catalog**: Fonts displayed with correct metadata
✅ **Preview**: Font rendering working with uploaded fonts
✅ **Features**: OpenType features extracted and toggleable
⚠️ **Persistence**: Requires Vercel KV/Blob setup for production

The system is now functionally complete for the critical flow you described.
